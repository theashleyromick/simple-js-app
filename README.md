## Objective
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## Context
This project provided me an opportunity to learn and demonstrate my skills in JavaScript by building a fully functional web application. The goal is to create a complete app that not only functions correctly but also is aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. 

## Features
- **Load Data:** Fetch data from an external API.
- **Display List:** Show a list of items (Pokémon) after the page loads.
- **View Details:** Display more details of an item (Pokémon) on demand via user interaction.
- **Styling:** Apply CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Complex UI Elements:** Implement complex UI patterns such as modals for item details.
